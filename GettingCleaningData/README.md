# Getting and Cleaning Data
Each sub-directory contains R code and related materials for each week's coding assignment. Namely:

##1. quiz1

##2. quiz2

##3. quiz3

##4. quiz4

##5. courseproject
To run the course project code, issue the following command:
```bash
Rscript run_analysis.R
```
The script will interactively ask for the absolute path to directory the course project data is extracted. Once a correct path is entered, it will execute the code and produce the output.txt file. Otherwise, error is thrown and program terminates.
